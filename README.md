# Sign-language-interpreter
This project is a real-time Sign Language Detection and Interpretation System that uses Deep Learning, OpenCV, and TensorFlow to detect hand gestures from a webcam feed and convert them into corresponding alphabetic characters. It aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the general public.
